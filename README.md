## Steps to run the programs
Open the Matlab Scripts and run them to get the output. The scripts are located as follows.
The outputs can be accessed as png files in the same folders.

1. LQR Implementation on Linearized System [LQR Linear](/LQR%20Linear/section_D_controllability.m)
2. LQR Implementation on Non Linear System [LQR Non Linear](/LQR%20Non%20Linear/lqr_on_non_linear_system.m)
3. LQG Implementation on Linearized System [LQG Linear](/LQG%20Linear/linear_lqg.m)  
4. LQG Implementation on Non Linear System [LQG Non Linear](/LQG%20Non%20Linear/nonlinear_lqg_controller.m)
5. Luenberger Observer for Linearized System [Luenberger Linear](/Luenberger%20Linear/luenberger_linear.m)
5. Luenberger Observer for Non Linear System [Luenberger Non Linear](/Luenberger%20Non%20Linear/non_linear_luenberger.m)

Note: Run All the Script Sections in sequence to get the correct output.
